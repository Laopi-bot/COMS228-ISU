Hello! Welcome to a repo of my completed assignments in the data structures class at Iowa State.

Our projcets Included
1.) Computing yearly profits of 2D grid of different typs of customers, 
    constantly updating based on who is next to them. 
2.) Read an input set of 2D integer points in a coordinate plane, and determine the median coordinate
    point, whose x-coordinate is equal to the mean of the x coordinates of the input points (same goes
    for the y coordinates).
3.) Implement a class called StoutList that extends AbstractSequentialList, along with inner classes
    for the different iterators it could have.
4.) Reconstruct/unzip a message archived with a binary-tree based algorithm.
